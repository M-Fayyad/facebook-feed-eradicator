# Facebook Feed Eradicator

## Overview

The **Facebook Feed Eradicator** is a simple yet powerful Chrome extension aimed at enhancing productivity by removing the distracting Facebook news feed. Instead of scrolling endlessly, users are greeted with motivational quotes, helping them stay focused on their tasks.

## Features

- **News Feed Removal**: Automatically hides the Facebook news feed upon login, allowing users to avoid distractions.
- **Motivational Quotes**: The empty feed space is replaced with a collection of inspirational quotes that encourage focus and productivity.
